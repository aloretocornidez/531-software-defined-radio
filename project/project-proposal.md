# Project Synopsis

The most common method for aircraft to report their system state involves the
use of the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) transmission
method. An open transmission method used to broadcast an aircraft's position,
enabling the ability to track the aircraft.

This project will focus on solving what is known as the "1090MHz Riddle". What
is the 1090 MHz Riddle you may ask? For many Software Defined Radio (SDR)
enthusiasts, being able to capture, decode, interpret, and transmit ADS-B
signals involves an understanding of how signals are are manipulated in the RF
spectrum, both for transmission and modulation. In our particular case, we would
like to know how we can use the 1090 MHz utilize for applications than just
aircraft information transmission.
