# Section 2

## Questions

1. Change 'filterUpsample' in `lab6part1.m` to 1 and observe the spectrum.
   Explain what you observe.
2. With the original `lab6part1.m` script increase the frequency offset in unit
   steps of $F_{s}$ Explain the observed effect.

3. When applying the frequency offset in lab6part1.m what is the reasoning
   behind incrementing the time vector?

4. Besides LO mismatches between transmitter and receiver, what are other
   possible sources of frequency offset?
