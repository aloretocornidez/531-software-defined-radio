# Questions

## Build your own CW radar with the PlutoSDR. What target(s) did you test against? Discuss results and observations in your lab report.

<!-- TODO -->

## Explain more than one reason for the strong return at zero Hertz (DC)?

There can be multiple reasons for returns at Zero Hertz(DC) of the frequency
spectrum. Since continuous wave radar focuses on finding the Doppler shift
between the Tx and Rx signals, whenever a target is stationary, the heterodyned
signal is received as a DC signal (specifically because the signal is processed
into baseband.) Summarized as a list, here are some reasons for high returns as
zero hertz:

1. Stationary Rx and Tx antennas (relative to the other) being shifted to
   baseband causes zero hertz interpretation.
2. Reflections from other objects that are not meant to be detected, such as a
   wall, or a body of water.

## What can be can be changed with physically to reduce the DC return?

To reduce DC returns in the physical sense, you can remove obstructions that are
close to the radio, this will get rid of the stationary objects that do not
cause doppler shifts, thus, removing DC components.

## For CW radar, as implemented in this lab, how would an interfering signal affect its operation? What design changes can be made to improve its resilience to interference?

Depending on what the interfering signal is doing, our system can be affected in
many ways, if the interfering signal is returning a frequency that is being
transmitted at a few hertz off of our baseband (after translation to baseband),
then our system would interpret that signal as an object that is consistently
moving towards (or away from) our radio at a certain velocity.

If the signal that is interfering is a frequency shifting signal, we may
interpret that interference as an object that is approaching faster or slower
than the actual object movement speed.

## How can the system be changed achieve range measurements?

To find out range measurements of the target,you can timestamp the inputs, as
well as calculate the Doppler shift of the frequencies, this information used
together can allow you to calculate the range of the target using the following
formula:

$$R = c \frac{T}{2} \frac{\Delta f}{f_{2} - f_{1}}$$

Where: $c$ is the speed of light, $\Delta f$ is the difference between the
transmitted and received signals, $f_{2}$ is the maximum transmitted frequency,
$f_{1}$ is the minimum transmitted frequency, $T$ is the period between $f_{1}$
and $f_{2}$, and the velocity is given by $v = \frac{d R}{d t}$.

This information is from
[this reference](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/continuous-wave-radar).

## What is the approximate angular velocity of the objects measured?

<!-- TODO -->

From the formula given above, we can measure the velocity of the ojects that I
measure, such as my hand moving back and forth, in this case, my had will cause
a Hz reading that goes from $0$ Hz to $400$ in about 0.4 seconds, so, let's plug
in the numbers that we have. Recall, $T = 1 \times 10^{9}$ seconds, and the
speed of light is approximately, $c = 3 \times 10^{8}$.

$$
R = (3 \times 10^{8}) \frac{10^{9}}{2} \frac{400}{(2.495 \times 10^9) - 2.4
\times 10^{9}}
$$

# Conclusion

<!-- TODO -->

As a car enthusiast, I learned how I can make a radar jammer using my
ADALM-Pluto today, as a law abiding student, I have learned that it is easy to
break the law throughout the course of the semester and that I have to be
careful when transmitting signals in any way.
